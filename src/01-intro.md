# Introduction

Lurk is a [verifiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_computing) [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) influenced by [Scheme](https://www.scheme.org/) and [Common Lisp](https://lisp-lang.org/).
As an application, it's capable of generating [zero-knowledge proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof) for the evaluation of arbitrary Lurk expressions.

This book explores Lurk from an usability standpoint, without deep diving into its cryptographic primitives.

We will start from installation instructions and then go through a gentle introduction to Lisp while building up the Lurk dialect as a means of designing systems in which parties can provably display possession of knowledge without disclosing it.

The "Language reference" chapter can be used as a precise reference for experienced users.
