# Getting started

## Setup

Clone the [lurk](https://github.com/argumentcomputer/lurk) repository and run the following command inside its folder:

```
$ cargo install --path .
```

This will make the `lurk` binary globally accessible from your terminal:

```
$ lurk
Lurk REPL welcomes you.
lurk-user> 
```

Having `lurk` installed can help the reader with experimentation while going through the book.
More detailed information on the features of the `lurk` app will be presented on a later chapter.

## Recommended tooling

* [lurk-vscode](https://github.com/argumentcomputer/lurk-vscode) is an extension for VS Code that provides syntax highlighting and interactions with the Lurk REPL
