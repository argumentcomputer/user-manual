# Getting started

## Setup

Clone the [lurk-rs](https://github.com/argumentcomputer/lurkrs) repository and run the following command inside its folder:

```
$ cargo install --path .
```

This will make the `lurk` binary globally accessible from your terminal:

```
$ lurk

```

Having `lurk` installed can help the reader with experimentation while going through the book.
More detailed information on the features of the `lurk` binary will be presented on a later chapter.
